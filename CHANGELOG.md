## Version 1.0.0
* Fixes
	* Fixed issue with some effects being considered polymorphs incorrectly
* Added Metamagic
	* Encouraging Metamagic
		* Any morale bonus granted by an encouraging spell is increased by 1.
* Added Mythic Feats
	* Critical Focus (Mythic)
		* You automatically confirm critical threats against non-mythic opponents. In addition, when you threaten a critical hit against a creature wearing armor with the fortification special ability or similar effect, that creature must roll twice and take the worse result when determining critical hit negation.
* Added Armor Mastery Feats
	* Intense Blows
		* When wearing heavy armor and using Power Attack, you gain a +1 bonus to your CMD until the beginning of your next turn. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, this bonus increases by another 1.
	* Knocking Blows
		* While wearing heavy armor if you hit a creature that is no more than one size category larger than you with a Power Attack, the creature you attacked is also knocked off balance. Until the beginning of your next turn, it takes a –4 penalty to its CMD against combat maneuvers that move it or knock it prone.
	* Secured Armor
		* When you are hit by a confirmed critical hit or a sneak attack while wearing medium or heavy armor, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Special: This chance stacks with the light fortification and moderate fortification armor special abilities.
	* Sprightly Armor
		* While wearing light armor you add your armor’s enhancement bonus as a bonus on your initiative checks.
* Added Shield Mastery Feats
	* Defended Movement
		* You gain a +2 bonus to your AC against attacks of opportunity.
	* Stumbling Bash
		* Creatures struck by your shield bash take a –2 penalty to their AC until the end of your next turn.
	* Toppling Bash
		* As a swift action when you hit a creature with a shield bash, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at a –5 penalty. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
